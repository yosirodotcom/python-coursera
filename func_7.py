# replace string in list with list comprehension

# This block of code also changes the year on a list of dates using a
# different approach than demonstrated in Skill Group 1. By using a 
# list comprehension, you can see how it is possible to refactor the
# code to a shorter, more efficient code block. 

# The "years" list is given with existing elements.
years = ["January 2023", "May 2025", "April 2023", "August 2024", "September 2025", "December 2023"]

# The list comprehension below creates a new list "updated_years" to
# hold the command to replace the "2023" substring of the "year"
# element with the substring "2024". This action will be executed if
# the last 4 indices of the "year" string is equal to the substring
# "2023". If false (else), the "year" element will be included in the
# new list "updated_years" unchanged.
updated_years = [year.replace("2023","2024") if year[-4:] == "2023" else year for year in years]


print(updated_years) 
# Should print ["January 2024", "May 2025", "April 2024", "August 2024", "September 2025", "December 2024"]
